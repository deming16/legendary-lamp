# Summary Report

## Units

Most condo listings in the 2 districts are 2 or 3 bedroom units that list between $1.3M to $2.4M. This is likely because district 3 and 5 are largely residential areas where families are looking to stay in. Hence 1 bedrooms are much less common in these 2 districts as they are too small for families. Meanwhile 4 bedrooms or larger will mean that it will likely be priced much higher than $2.4M which is likely to be then out of reach for many of the families.

Hence, developers build the condo projects with their targeted buyers in mind and build more of 2/3 bedroom units which likely resulted in more of such units in the market

We can see that Normanton Park and Avenue South have extremely huge number of listings out at the same time. For sellers and potential future owners of these condos it could mean that these 2 projects would face huge competitions from other listing and may find it harder to sell their property off in the future.

Surprisingly, Stirling Residence being a mega project only has 25 listings and is lesser than other smaller projects.

With the sample size being around 1k, It seems that there is no agent that is dominating the listings in these 2 districts. Most agents would have had 4 or lesser listings ongoing at the same time. Sellers can be more assured here that their property would have their agents put in more time and effort into it.
